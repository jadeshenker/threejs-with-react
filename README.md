# Three.js in React 

ObjectPicking.js adapts [this three.js tutorial on object picking](https://soledadpenades.com/articles/three-js-tutorials/object-picking/) for React. this project also updates some three.js methods which are now outdated. 

PointRaycasting.js adapts [this three.js raycasting example](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_interactive_raycasting_points.html) for React.

to switch easily between tutorials, replace the App component with ToggleView in index.js. using ToggleView you can easily explore both tutorials, though this may slow down your system. alternatively, replace the components in App.js and recompile.
